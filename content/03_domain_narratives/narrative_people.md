# Narrative: People, Capacity, and Cost Reality

In services firms, people are both the greatest asset and the largest source of commercial risk.

Most profit volatility is not caused by pricing alone, but by mismatches between capacity, utilisation, and true cost. These mismatches are often invisible until they have already impacted margin and cash.

## Why people decisions are hard to get right

As firms grow, people decisions become increasingly complex.

Leadership teams must balance:
- hiring ahead of demand versus protecting cash
- utilisation targets versus sustainable workloads
- senior capability versus cost leverage
- permanent staff versus contractors or offshore capacity

Each decision has a financial consequence. Yet those consequences are rarely visible in a timely or consistent way.

## The illusion of averages

Many firms manage people cost using averages:
- average daily rates
- average utilisation targets
- blended cost assumptions
- notional bench percentages

While useful at a high level, averages hide variability.

In reality:
- not all capacity is interchangeable
- seniority mix matters
- utilisation risk concentrates unevenly
- unassigned capacity is costly even when it appears temporary

This creates false confidence in staffing decisions.

## The bench problem

The bench is often discussed as a temporary inefficiency.

In practice, it is a structural cost that requires deliberate management.

Without forward visibility:
- hiring decisions are made too early or too late
- bench cost accumulates quietly
- pressure shifts to delivery teams to absorb inefficiencies
- cash impact arrives before corrective action is possible

The issue is not having a bench. It is not understanding its cost and duration.

## Capacity as a forward decision

Capacity is not a static number.

It is shaped continuously by:
- pipeline conversion timing
- project ramp-up and ramp-down
- leave, attrition, and onboarding delays
- changes in delivery models and staffing mix

Managing capacity effectively requires a forward-looking view that connects people decisions to workload and financial impact.

## How Profitdrive reframes people management

Profitdrive reframes people management as a commercial decision discipline rather than an HR or scheduling exercise.

It provides:
- true cost visibility at a daily and role level
- a forward view of capacity versus committed and potential work
- early signals when utilisation risk is emerging
- clarity on the financial impact of hiring and resourcing choices

This allows leadership teams to make people decisions with intent rather than urgency.

---

## Better conversations about cost

With clearer cost and capacity visibility:

- hiring discussions become evidence-based
- trade-offs between seniority, leverage, and margin are explicit
- delivery pressure is reduced through earlier planning
- finance conversations shift from explanation to direction

People decisions become calmer and more deliberate.

## The outcome

When people and capacity are managed with forward commercial clarity, profit volatility reduces and confidence increases.

Teams are staffed more predictably. Bench risk is visible rather than hidden. Growth becomes easier to support without destabilising cash or margin.

Profitdrive enables this by making the financial consequences of people decisions visible early enough to change them.
