# Persona: Operations / Delivery Leader

## The situation

As a delivery or operations leader in a growing services firm, you sit at the intersection of ambition and reality.

Sales targets are increasing. Delivery commitments are broader and more complex. Teams are larger, more distributed, and operating across multiple delivery models. Expectations are high, but clarity is often limited.

You are accountable for execution, yet many of the assumptions that shape delivery sit outside your direct control.

## What has changed

Earlier in the firm’s life, delivery was simpler.

You could:
- see upcoming work clearly
- staff projects with known people and skills
- resolve issues directly and quickly
- understand the cost impact of delivery choices

As the firm scales, delivery becomes fragmented.

Decisions now arrive:
- already priced and sold
- with optimistic assumptions embedded
- without a clear view of true cost or capacity
- under time pressure to mobilise

Delivery is expected to absorb uncertainty created elsewhere.

## The pressure points

Operations and delivery leaders in this position often experience:

- Projects that look viable at deal stage but strain margin in execution
- Resourcing plans that assume availability that does not exist
- Constant re-planning to manage utilisation and bench risk
- Escalations driven by misalignment rather than poor execution
- A growing burden of reporting to explain outcomes

The problem is rarely delivery capability. It is late visibility.

## What you need to execute well

Effective delivery at scale depends on a small number of conditions:

- Clear commercial boundaries for each piece of work
- Realistic staffing assumptions aligned to capacity
- Early signals when delivery is drifting from plan
- Alignment between sales intent and operational reality

Without these, delivery becomes reactive and margin is eroded through effort rather than intent.

## How Profitdrive helps

Profitdrive supports operations and delivery leaders by creating shared commercial clarity across the business.

It provides:
- visibility into the commercial assumptions behind deals
- a forward view of workload, capacity, and utilisation risk
- early indicators when delivery plans threaten profit boundaries
- a common language to discuss trade-offs with sales and leadership

Rather than adding process, it removes guesswork.

## What changes as a result

With clearer commercial context:

- Delivery planning becomes more predictable
- Resourcing decisions improve without constant escalation
- Conversations with sales shift from conflict to collaboration
- Issues surface earlier, when they are easier to resolve

Execution quality improves because expectations are grounded in reality.

## The outcome

Profitdrive enables operations and delivery leaders to focus on what they do best: delivering quality outcomes predictably.

Not by taking ownership away, but by ensuring decisions upstream are informed, aligned, and commercially sound. This reduces friction, protects margin, and restores confidence across delivery teams.
