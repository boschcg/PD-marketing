# Persona: CEO / Founder

## The situation

As the CEO or founder of a growing IT or professional services firm, you are no longer managing a small, contained business.

Headcount has increased. Delivery is happening across multiple projects. Pricing decisions are delegated. Senior leaders have been added to scale the organisation. Revenue is growing, but the business feels harder to steer.

You are accountable for outcomes, but increasingly distant from the decisions that shape them.

---

## What has changed

In the early stages, commercial judgement was instinctive.

You could:
- sense whether a deal made sense
- see delivery issues as they emerged
- understand the cost impact of hiring decisions
- course-correct quickly

As the firm grows, that intuition no longer scales.

Decisions are now:
- distributed across sales and delivery leaders
- made with partial visibility into cost and capacity
- justified through reports that arrive after the fact

You still carry responsibility for profit and cash, but confidence in forward decisions has diminished.

---

## The pressure points

CEOs and founders in this position often experience:

- Growth that feels positive but financially fragile
- Increasing reliance on a small number of trusted individuals to interpret reality
- Difficulty separating short-term revenue opportunity from long-term margin risk
- Board or investor questions that require explanation rather than conviction
- A growing sense that the business is reacting rather than steering

The issue is not leadership capability. It is decision visibility.

---

## What you need to decide well

At this stage, the quality of a small number of decisions determines outcomes:

- Which deals to pursue and on what terms
- How aggressively to invest in senior leadership and capability
- When to shift delivery models or pricing structures
- How to balance utilisation, bench, and growth capacity
- Whether the current trajectory supports long-term value creation

These are not operational questions. They are commercial judgement calls.

## How Profitdrive helps

Profitdrive supports CEOs and founders by making the financial consequences of decisions visible early enough to change them.

It provides:
- a forward view of profit and cash under different growth paths
- clarity on the true cost and capacity implications of decisions
- a shared commercial model that aligns leadership discussions
- early warning signals when trajectory drifts from intent

Rather than replacing judgement, it sharpens it.

---

## What changes as a result

With forward commercial visibility:

- Growth decisions are made with greater confidence
- Trade-offs are explicit rather than implicit
- Board conversations shift from explanation to direction
- Reliance on instinct alone decreases without losing agility

You regain the ability to steer deliberately, even as complexity increases.

---

## The outcome

Profitdrive gives CEOs and founders a calmer, clearer operating position.

Not because the business is simpler, but because the consequences of decisions are visible sooner. This allows you to grow the firm, invest with intent, and maintain control of profit as the organisation evolves.
