# Narrative: Projects and the Profit Boundary

In services firms, projects are where commercial intent meets operational reality.

A deal may be priced correctly and sold with confidence, yet profit is ultimately determined during delivery. Once a project is underway, many of the most important commercial decisions are no longer adjustable.

This makes projects the critical point at which profit is either protected or eroded.

## Why projects drift commercially

Commercial drift in projects rarely comes from poor execution.

It emerges from:
- optimistic assumptions embedded at deal stage
- scope that is commercially sound but operationally ambiguous
- resourcing plans that change under delivery pressure
- delivery decisions made without clear visibility of profit impact

Each adjustment appears reasonable in isolation. Collectively, they redefine the economics of the work.

## The profit boundary problem

Most delivery teams focus on completing work efficiently and satisfying clients. Commercial boundaries are often implicit rather than explicit.

Without a clearly defined profit boundary:
- scope adjustments feel harmless
- additional effort is absorbed rather than assessed
- utilisation inefficiencies compound unnoticed
- margin erosion becomes visible only after the project concludes

The issue is not intent. It is missing visibility.

## Fixed-price work magnifies the risk

Fixed-price and outcome-based projects magnify commercial risk.

Revenue is locked in early, while delivery effort remains uncertain. Small deviations in scope, staffing mix, or productivity directly impact profit.

Without early warning signals, delivery teams are asked to recover margin through effort alone, often at the cost of predictability and morale.

## From tracking progress to managing boundaries

Traditional project tracking focuses on:
- milestones
- timelines
- burn rates
- utilisation

While necessary, these metrics do not answer the most important question:
“Are we still operating within the intended profit boundary?”

Managing projects commercially requires linking delivery activity back to the assumptions that shaped the deal.

## How Profitdrive reframes project control

Profitdrive reframes project management around commercial boundaries rather than task execution.

It:
- makes the profit boundary explicit at project start
- connects delivery effort to margin impact in real time
- highlights deviation early, while corrective options still exist
- supports informed trade-offs between scope, staffing, and outcome

This enables delivery teams to manage with intent rather than react to surprises.

## Better alignment between sales and delivery

When projects are anchored to clear commercial assumptions:
- delivery teams understand the rationale behind constraints
- sales teams see how deal structure affects execution
- leadership can intervene earlier with clarity rather than urgency

The handover between sales and delivery becomes a point of alignment rather than friction.

---

## The outcome

Projects managed with explicit profit boundaries are calmer and more predictable.

Delivery decisions remain flexible, but their commercial consequences are visible. Margin is protected through awareness rather than enforcement.

Profitdrive enables this by ensuring that commercial intent survives the transition from deal to delivery.
