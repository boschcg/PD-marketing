# Profitdrive

## Commercial decision clarity for services firms

Profitdrive is a commercial decision system for services firms that makes the financial consequences of growth, pricing, and delivery decisions visible early enough to change them.

Most firms do not lose margin because teams work hard. They lose margin because assumptions are set early, then treated as facts. Pricing, staffing, utilisation, delivery commitments, and overhead growth drift out of alignment. The business keeps moving, but confidence declines.

Profitdrive gives leadership a shared commercial view across sales intent, delivery reality, capacity, and forward-looking profit.

## The complexity trap

As services firms scale, complexity increases faster than management systems evolve.

- Pipeline grows, but deal assumptions are inconsistent.
- Delivery ramps, but handovers recreate the same discovery work.
- Utilisation becomes a monthly debate rather than a managed variable.
- Overheads expand, but the profit boundary is not explicit.
- Reporting explains the past, but decisions are required in advance.

The result is predictable: margin leakage, reactive hiring, longer cycles, and a gradual loss of control.

Profitdrive is designed to break that pattern by making the commercial model explicit and continuously updated.

## What Profitdrive does

Profitdrive connects five realities that are usually fragmented:

1. **Sales intent**  
   Capture the assumptions that matter before the win. Pricing logic, delivery shape, and capacity implications.

2. **Delivery commitments**  
   Translate intent into a delivery plan with clear boundaries. Separate revenue logic from effort and protect fixed-price margins.

3. **People cost and capacity**  
   Resolve true daily cost, availability, and unassigned capacity deterministically, not by spreadsheet interpretation.

4. **Overheads and operating model**  
   Keep the cost base visible as it evolves, and model the impact on profit outcomes.

5. **Forward profit outlook**  
   Provide a forward-looking P&L trajectory built from the same commercial engine that drives pipeline and delivery decisions.

Profitdrive does not replace your accounting system, payroll, or PSA. It provides the decision layer that most firms operate without.

## How it helps leaders act earlier

Profitdrive supports the decisions that typically determine outcomes:

- Pricing and delivery assumptions before contracts are signed
- Hiring and capacity trade-offs before cost is locked in
- Fixed-price governance before delivery begins
- Bench visibility and redeployment before utilisation declines
- Scenario steering before results show up in month-end reporting
- Exit readiness through consistent, investor-grade commercial logic

This is commercial discipline without administrative drag.

## Built for the way services firms actually run

### For founders and CEOs
Steer growth with clarity on profit, risk, and cashflow implications before you commit.

### For operations and delivery leaders
Reduce handover friction and protect delivery economics with a shared model and clear profit boundaries.

### For sales leaders
Price with confidence using the same assumptions engine that delivery uses to plan and govern the work.

### For finance leaders
Move from retrospective variance explanation to forward trajectory management, with high-trust inputs and consistent logic.

## Why this is different from process tools

Project tools manage tasks. PSAs capture activity. CRMs track opportunities. Finance systems record outcomes.

Profitdrive focuses on the gap between intent and outcome: the commercial assumptions and decisions that determine whether growth compounds or erodes value.

It is deliberately designed to support judgement rather than replace it.
