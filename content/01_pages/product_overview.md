# Product Overview
## A commercial decision system for services firms

Profitdrive is a commercial decision system for IT and professional services firms that makes the financial consequences of growth, pricing, and delivery decisions visible early enough to change them.

It does not replace accounting systems, PSA tools, or ERP platforms. It sits above them, translating operational activity into forward-looking commercial insight so leaders can steer the business deliberately rather than explain outcomes after the fact.

## The problem with traditional stacks

Most services firms grow by layering systems:
- Accounting for compliance and reporting
- PSA for projects and utilisation
- CRM for pipeline and sales activity
- Spreadsheets to reconcile what none of the above connect

Each system performs its function, but none provide a unified view of how commercial decisions propagate across the business. Pricing is set without full cost visibility. Deals are won without understanding delivery implications. Hiring decisions are made without a clear view of forward profit or cash impact.

The result is a familiar pattern:
- Revenue grows, margins soften
- Delivery friction increases
- Confidence in forward decisions erodes
- Leadership relies on retrospective reports to explain outcomes

Profitdrive was built to address this gap.

## What Profitdrive unifies

Profitdrive connects the commercial elements that determine profit in a services business into a single decision framework:

- Pipeline intent and deal structure
- Pricing logic and margin assumptions
- Delivery models and staffing commitments
- Cost reality, utilisation, and capacity
- Forward profit, cash, and risk trajectory

Rather than treating these as separate operational concerns, Profitdrive models how they interact before decisions are locked in.

This allows leaders to see not just what is happening, but what is likely to happen if a decision is taken.

## From activity to trajectory

Traditional systems answer the question:
“What happened last month?”

Profitdrive answers a different question:
“If we proceed like this, where does the business land?”

Every major decision creates a trajectory:
- Winning a deal
- Changing a delivery model
- Adding senior leadership cost
- Shifting toward fixed price work
- Expanding into a new industry

Profitdrive makes those trajectories explicit. It shows how today’s choices shape profit, utilisation, and risk over the coming months, while there is still time to intervene.

---

## Designed for executive decisions, not administration

Profitdrive is not designed to increase administrative burden.

It does not require teams to adopt new operational workflows or duplicate effort. Instead, it focuses on the points where judgement matters:
- Deal structure before contracts are signed
- Staffing assumptions before commitments are made
- Cost visibility before hiring decisions are locked in
- Profit boundaries before delivery drifts

The system supports discussion, challenge, and alignment at leadership level, while execution remains with management teams.

---

## How leaders typically use Profitdrive

Leadership teams use Profitdrive to:
- Test the commercial soundness of growth plans
- Pressure-test pricing and margin assumptions
- Understand the forward impact of delivery and hiring decisions
- Align sales ambition with operational reality
- Maintain profit discipline as complexity increases

For firms considering fractional CFO or COO support, Profitdrive provides the underlying commercial visibility that enables better decisions without adding permanent management overhead.

---

## What Profitdrive is not

Profitdrive is intentionally narrow in what it does not attempt to be.

It is not:
- A project management tool
- A timesheet replacement
- An accounting or payroll system
- A process enforcement platform

Those systems remain in place. Profitdrive exists to connect their outputs into a coherent commercial view that leadership can act on.

---

## Built from lived operating experience

Profitdrive reflects more than two decades of direct COO and CFO responsibility within services organisations. It is shaped by the realities of scaling, margin pressure, acquisitions, and board-level scrutiny.

The system embeds commercial logic that experienced operators apply instinctively, making it visible, testable, and repeatable as organisations grow beyond founder-led control.

---

## The outcome

Profitdrive enables a shift:
- From reactive explanation to deliberate steering
- From fragmented views to a single commercial truth
- From intuition-led growth to evidence-backed decisions

It gives leadership teams the confidence to grow, invest, and change direction with a clear understanding of the financial consequences before they become irreversible.
