# How to Trial Profitdrive

Profitdrive is designed to be experienced, not sold through promises.

Most leadership teams want to understand whether clearer commercial visibility will materially change decisions in their business before committing to broader adoption. A Profitdrive trial is intentionally structured to answer that question quickly and with minimal disruption.

## The purpose of a trial

A Profitdrive trial is not a system rollout.

Its purpose is to:
- test whether earlier commercial visibility improves decision quality
- surface where margin, capacity, or risk is being shaped upstream
- validate that insights are actionable, not theoretical

The focus is on decisions, not configuration.

## What a trial typically covers

Trials are deliberately scoped and time-bound. They usually focus on one or two of the following areas:

- **Pipeline decisions**  
  Understanding the commercial quality of upcoming deals before commitment.

- **Delivery and project economics**  
  Making profit boundaries explicit on selected projects.

- **Capacity and people decisions**  
  Gaining forward visibility into utilisation, bench risk, and hiring impact.

- **Forward profit and cash outlook**  
  Connecting firm workload and pipeline intent into a clear trajectory.

The objective is to apply Profitdrive where decision friction is already visible.

## What is required from your team

A trial does not require operational change.

Typically:
- existing data sources are used
- current tools remain in place
- no new workflows are imposed on teams
- configuration is kept intentionally light

Engagement is limited to a small group of leaders involved in the relevant decisions.

---

## What you will see during the trial

During the trial, leadership teams typically gain:

- earlier visibility into the financial consequences of decisions
- clearer trade-offs between growth, margin, and capacity
- a shared commercial language across functions
- insight into where assumptions diverge from reality

The value is not the numbers themselves, but the quality of discussion they enable.

---

## What a trial is not

To set expectations clearly, a trial is not:
- a full implementation
- a replacement of existing systems
- a reporting exercise
- a consulting engagement that produces a slide deck

It is a practical test of whether forward commercial clarity improves outcomes.

---

## Typical duration

Trials are short by design.

Most are completed within:
- 4 to 6 weeks
- aligned to natural decision cycles
- without interrupting day-to-day operations

This ensures momentum without long-term commitment.

---

## The outcome of a trial

At the end of a trial, leadership teams are able to answer a small number of critical questions:

- Did we see issues earlier than we would have otherwise?
- Did this change the quality of our decisions?
- Did it reduce friction between sales, delivery, and finance?
- Is this capability valuable enough to embed long term?

If the answer is yes, adoption is a natural next step.  
If not, the trial has still created clarity without cost or disruption.

## A deliberate next step

Profitdrive trials are designed to be low-risk, contained, and informative.

They allow leadership teams to experience forward commercial clarity in their own context, before deciding whether to make it a permanent capability.
