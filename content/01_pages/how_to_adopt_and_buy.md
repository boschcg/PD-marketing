# How Profitdrive Is Adopted and Bought

Profitdrive is adopted as a commercial capability, not implemented as a traditional software system.

The aim is to embed clearer decision-making into how leadership teams already operate, without disrupting delivery, finance, or sales workflows.

---

## From trial to adoption

Most firms engage with Profitdrive through a scoped trial.

When teams choose to proceed, adoption builds directly on what was tested:
- the same decision areas
- the same data sources
- the same leadership rhythm

There is no reset or reimplementation. The trial becomes the foundation for ongoing use.

---

## What adoption looks like in practice

Adoption is intentionally lightweight.

Typically:
- existing systems remain unchanged
- Profitdrive continues to sit above current tools
- leadership discussions become more structured around shared commercial views
- insights are refined rather than rebuilt

Teams do not need to “use” Profitdrive daily for it to be effective. It is used where and when decisions are made.

---

## Who is typically involved

Profitdrive is adopted by leadership teams, not rolled out to the entire organisation.

In most firms, this includes:
- CEO or Managing Director
- COO, Head of Delivery, or Operations Lead
- Finance lead or commercial owner
- Select sales or practice leaders where relevant

This keeps adoption focused on decision quality rather than broad process change.

## What changes and what does not

**What changes**
- Decisions are discussed with clearer visibility into consequence
- Trade-offs between growth, margin, and capacity are explicit
- Leadership alignment improves around commercial assumptions
- Issues surface earlier, while options still exist

**What does not change**
- Delivery teams continue using existing tools
- Sales processes remain in place
- Accounting and payroll systems are unaffected
- Operational ownership stays with management

Adoption improves clarity, not complexity.

---

## Commercial model

Profitdrive is offered as an ongoing commercial capability.

This reflects:
- the evolving nature of decisions
- the need for continuous visibility
- the value of consistent commercial discipline

Commercial arrangements are designed to scale with the firm and remain proportionate to its size and complexity.

---

## When adoption makes sense

Firms typically adopt Profitdrive when:
- growth has outpaced informal control
- margin outcomes are becoming unpredictable
- leadership wants earlier visibility into risk and opportunity
- reliance on individual judgement alone feels insufficient

It is particularly relevant where boards or investors expect clearer forward commercial narratives.

---

## A deliberate choice

Profitdrive is not designed for every organisation.

It is a good fit for firms that want:
- better decisions rather than more reporting
- clarity rather than control-heavy governance
- a sustainable way to protect margin under growth

Adoption is a deliberate choice to embed forward commercial clarity as the business evolves.
